                <p> <big> A population is a distinct group of individuals, whether that group comprises a nation or a
                        group
                        of people with a common characteristic. In statistics, a population is the pool of individuals
                        from
                        which a statistical sample is drawn for a study.In This Website, We are going to do a comparison
                        between the population of Haryana and Punjab in last 4 years </big></p>

                <p> <big> <b><u>Birth Rate:</u></b></big> Birth rate is the number of individuals born in a population
                    in a
                    given
                    amount of time. Human birth rate is stated as the number of individuals born per year per 1000 in
                    the
                    population. For example, if 35 births occur per year per 1000 individuals, the birth rate is 35. <a

                <p><big><b><u>Death Rate:</u></b></big> Death rate, is a measure of the number of deaths <i>(in general,
                        or
                        due to a specific cause)</i>in a particular population, scaled to the size of that population,
                    per
                    unit of time. Mortality rate is typically expressed in units of deaths per 1,000 individuals per
                    year;
                    thus, a mortality rate of 9.5 <i>(out of 1,000)</i> in a population of 1,000 would mean 9.5 deaths
                    per
                    year in that entire population, or 0.95% out of the total. It is distinct from <i> "Morbidity"</i>,
                    which is either the prevalence or incidence of a disease, and also from the incidence rate <i> (the
                        number of newly appearing cases of the disease per unit of time.) </i> <a

                <p><big><u><b>Infant Mortality rate:</b></u></big> Infant mortality is the death of an infant before his
                    or
                    her first birthday. The infant mortality rate is the number of infant deaths for every 1,000 live
                    births. In addition to giving us key information about maternal and infant health, the infant
                    mortality
                    rate is an important marker of the overall health of a society. In 2018, the infant mortality rate
                    in
                    the United States was 5.7 deaths per 1,000 live births. <a
